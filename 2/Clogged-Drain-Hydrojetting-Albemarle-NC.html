<p>Backflow preventers are critical for developing a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be appropriately kept. The brine service should be mixed and saved in the brine tank. Periodic blocking of the resin likewise requires special attention.

If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to assist break up the material. Likewise, bacteria and fungi also form mats in the resin that decrease its effectiveness.

<p>Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
