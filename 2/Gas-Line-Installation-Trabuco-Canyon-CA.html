<p>To make positioning a toilet easier, new toilet bolts are extra long. That implies you need to cut off the protruding ends later on with a hacksaw.

<p>Once, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that must be.

<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Corrosion can literally eat a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or alter the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
