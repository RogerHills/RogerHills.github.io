<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
