<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
