<p>Backflow preventers are critical for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The salt water option should be mixed and kept in the salt water tank. Periodic clogging of the resin likewise needs special attention.

If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Similarly, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these annoyances.
