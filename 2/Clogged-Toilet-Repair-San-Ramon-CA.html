CPVC pipes are also made of plastic, however they're not as flexible or long lasting as PEX pipes. They can likewise end up being fragile over time.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
