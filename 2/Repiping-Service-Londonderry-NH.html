A lot of houses in the United States, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank till the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades in time enabling water to leave into the toilet bowl, therefore lowering the amount of water in the tank available for a flush.  It also has the downside of increasing your water costs due to wastage of water.</p>
