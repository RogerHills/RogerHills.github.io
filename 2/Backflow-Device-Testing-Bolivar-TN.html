<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is necessary to pinpoint the precise area of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the issue. The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance city, company or real estate agent inspector.</p>
<p>During water, electricity and installation are shut off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are eliminated and cleaned up of any putty. Loosen the nuts that link the drain pipe, consisting of the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections. Place a pail below the drain pipe to catch any water that leaks out.</p>
