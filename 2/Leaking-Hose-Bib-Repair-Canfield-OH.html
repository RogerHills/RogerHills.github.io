<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Canfield OH</h3>

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to get in the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
