<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Decatur IN</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
