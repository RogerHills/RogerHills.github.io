<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last couple of years.

<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
