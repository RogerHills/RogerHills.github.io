<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners offer nowadays. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Service providers then typically blow the liner into an existing pipe.
