<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
