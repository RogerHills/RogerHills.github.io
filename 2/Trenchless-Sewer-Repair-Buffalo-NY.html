Possibilities are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates if your house was developed decades before that.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or apartment board.

Lawbreakers will be responsible for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
