<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
