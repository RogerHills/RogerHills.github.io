<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system should be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>The above techniques, of distillation and reverse osmosis, are the most widely used two non-chemical approaches of water softening.
