If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and manages atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will often need to be changed rather than fixed. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or emitting foul smells.</p>
