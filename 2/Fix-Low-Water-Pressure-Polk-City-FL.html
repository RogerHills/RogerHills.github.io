That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and regulates atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will typically need to be replaced instead of fixed.
