I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
