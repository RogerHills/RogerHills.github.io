<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
