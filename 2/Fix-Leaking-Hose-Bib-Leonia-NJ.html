<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close.

<p>Mechanical water softening systems are therefore likewise called ion exchange water softeners. The best way to clear a clogged drain without damaging your pipes and plumbing system is to get in touch with a relied on local plumber at ABC. The pipe that connects your sink to the main supply, contains water at high pressures. A leak in this system will be immediately noticeable. The defected part will either spray or drip profusely, depending on the damage.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can save you money and time as well as protect your health in the future. After softening a big amount of tough water, the exchange medium ends up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions. When this occurs, the exchange medium must be recharged or regenerated (Figure 1).
