<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>If your polybutylene pipes have failed, read your insurance policy completely. Ensure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Numerous insurance provider will not cover a sluggish leak.
