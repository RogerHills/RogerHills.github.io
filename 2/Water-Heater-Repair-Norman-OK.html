<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your home. Even if the problem comes from with the community system, it's still smart to generate the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>

While a high quality, high horse power disposal can grind and press just about anything down the kitchen sink, it does not mean it benefits the pipes. Gas shut-off valve installation expenses between $52 and $138 per device, including labor and materials. Materials cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour. A shut-off valve is required to turn off the gas to the house whenever a home appliance requires repair or for emergencies.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
