<h3>Frozen Pips in Fairview Oregon</h2>

<p>New houses developed with copper pipes are particularly prone to destructive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being coated within. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a duration of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
