<h3>When To Call A Plumber Riverton UT</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
