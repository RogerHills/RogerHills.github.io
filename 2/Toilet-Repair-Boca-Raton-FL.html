<p>Regrettably, the plumbing in older buildings can fail. When the pipes begin to corrode, it impacts your water system. Contaminated water is a health threat and must be dealt with rapidly. Rust can likewise split, break, or burst pipes and ruin your walls or floors. We correct small leakages without repiping, however if you experience chronic leak or a slab leak, it may be time for a total plumbing overhaul.</p>
<p>In addition to work on standard hot water heater, we carry out both setups and repairs of tankless hot water heater. Need a plumbing contractor to assist on your remodel or brand-new building job? It's our specialty. Give us a call at 206-633-1700. We eagerly anticipate working with you. A leaking toilet is another common problem house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This issue is typically triggered by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn out flapper valve.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Often the type and installation requirements are spelled out by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building regulations for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon prior to it can occur, avoiding contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow range from the relatively basic to the very sophisticated and complicated.</p>
