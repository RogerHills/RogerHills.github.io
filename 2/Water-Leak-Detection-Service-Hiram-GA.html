<p>Noticeable smell. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or business place, give us a call.

If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will typically need to be replaced rather than repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or producing foul smells, you'll know this.</p>

I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
