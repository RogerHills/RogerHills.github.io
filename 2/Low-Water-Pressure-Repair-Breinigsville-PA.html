Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A great location to begin trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is underneath the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the wetness most.</p>
<p>However, you also need to consider the age of your system. If your system is getting near 10 years old, it's normally not a good idea to spend for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the price of a new system.
