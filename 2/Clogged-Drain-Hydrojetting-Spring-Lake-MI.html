<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
