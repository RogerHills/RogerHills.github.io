<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
