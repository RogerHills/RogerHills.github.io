<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, broken pipe out while changing it with a brand-new one at the same time. We did a follow-up call to the homeowner several weeks later on, and she reported no excess water in her backyard. Task well done: You don't wish to end up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a certified plumber guarantees a smooth installation procedure.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I purchased separately from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>As pointed out, clogged or blocked drains and pipes can trigger damage to your house. Not just can dirty pipes cause your water to drain slowly, however it can also cause pipes to burst and septic tank back-ups. Ensure you do not have a plumbing disaster and make sure your pipes are clean. 1. Get rid of the garbage disposer and detach all the old traps and drain lines from beneath the sink.</p>
