<p>If you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a few times, it's a great concept to have a professional evaluate your drain system. A drain professional like TLC will use a camera to inspect your drain system. Frequently, if you have numerous drain problems you may have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can identify the problem and find so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>Electric water heaters do have a couple of drawbacks however that are worth pointing out. Most importantly, electrical power is not as cheap as gas. Some energy companies charge greater rates for electrical power during peak periods such as very early in the morning and at night. Utilizing your heater throughout these peak periods can increase your power expenses. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a fixed rate. Another downside of an electrical water heater is that they can be costly to install, specifically when it pertains to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
