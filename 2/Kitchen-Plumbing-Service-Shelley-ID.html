Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
