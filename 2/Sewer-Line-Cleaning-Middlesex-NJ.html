<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Middlesex NJ</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
