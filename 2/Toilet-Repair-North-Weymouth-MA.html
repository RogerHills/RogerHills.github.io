<p>Plumbing is the practice, products and fixtures utilized in the installation, maintenance, extension, and alteration of all piping, components, plumbing appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with sanitary drainage or storm drainage centers; venting systems and public or personal water supply systems, within or surrounding to any structure or structure.</p>
<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the outer finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe include rust in your supply of water, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not always indicate repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to figure out the best strategy.</p>
