<p>When choosing the correct system defense there are a number of factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be taken a look at on a private basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to fulfill that specific threat or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very various fire protection system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
