<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
