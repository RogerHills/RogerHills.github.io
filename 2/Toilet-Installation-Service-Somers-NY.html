If yours is acting up and is near completion of its life-span, which typically lasts five to 10 years, it might make more sense to replace it than repair it.</p>
<p>Leakages can happen if the seal between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain fails. Since the tank or the whole toilet should be raised off the floor for a proper repair, either of these leaks can be difficult to fix by yourself.
