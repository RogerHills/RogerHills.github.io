I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine.
