<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Montebello CA</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a house owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and determine issue. This type of camera is specifically helpful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
<p>For gas lines that should be run under ground, a special kind of black pipe must be used that is coated with an unique plastic product that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is quickly discernible from underground water lines, and also because the plastic covering in fact safeguards the pipe better than a galvanized coating would.</p>
