<p>Wood pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood.

About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
