<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Leominster MA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these concerns.</p>
