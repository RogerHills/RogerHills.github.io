Even if you take good care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases blockages are unavoidable.

Holding the mount ring at the topmost part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, ensuring that the rubber of the cushion mount is completely and securely locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When installed correctly, you need to not be able to eliminate the cushion mount without considerable stretching and pulling, and the mount ring needs to rotate freely around it.</p>

<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home. Then that generally implies that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your home. This can happen in multiple locations and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your home.</p>
