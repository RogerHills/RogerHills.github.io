<p>In community water supply systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or organisation. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario occurs, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention approach utilized. The best and most safe type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The correct backflow prevention device is needed if an air space is not possible.
