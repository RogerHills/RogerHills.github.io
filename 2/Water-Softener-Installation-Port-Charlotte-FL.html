<p>After showing up after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they would not take responsibility if it dripped now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, since I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
