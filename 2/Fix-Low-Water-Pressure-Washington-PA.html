<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Washington PA</h3>
<p>Tough water can wreck havoc on your home's plumbing and appliances by causing scale accumulation in your pipes, blocking them and the aerators. As soon as this happens it will cause a decrease in the water pressure and likewise considerably reduces the lifespan of all household devices. Water leaks: If you see a leak in your pipes, there may be other leaks you are uninformed of. Leakages are a sure indication that your pipes are old and worn and need to be changed. Rather than having to continuously repair them, the best choice. is to replace them.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
