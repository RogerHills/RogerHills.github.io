<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
