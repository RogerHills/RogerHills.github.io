I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
