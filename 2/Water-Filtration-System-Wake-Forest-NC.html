<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system supplying the makeup water, backpressure is developed. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential pollutants can then enter the potable water supply. The very best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
