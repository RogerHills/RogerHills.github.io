When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, in addition to examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
