<h3>Faucet Leaking in Loma Linda California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
