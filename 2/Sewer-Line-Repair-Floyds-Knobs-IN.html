It is also a piece of plumbing equipment that we forget about till we awaken to a cold shower. We might hear the hot water heater making noise, trying to tell us there is a problem, however we overlook it which may cause a more substantial repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It is essential to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible.
