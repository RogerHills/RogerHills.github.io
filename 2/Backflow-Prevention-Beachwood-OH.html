The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Total expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping needed to connect to the main gas supply, which typically averages 30'.</p>
<p>The amount of warm water you utilize each day and whether your existing water heater is able to satisfy that demand. This quantity is generally based on the variety of people in your home. The immediate advantage to this is superior schedule for houses and areas with higher requirements. While an electrical heater might serve for smaller families, the gas heater might be a much better option for matching needs.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can purchase models with unique features that do everything but add the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm assurance that the special feature will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic system, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
