If your home was developed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was constructed decades prior to that, chances are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at ideal rates.</p>
<p>There are several indications to look out for. 1) The surface of the floor in one area is warm or perhaps hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all appliances and components in your house have actually been shut off. 3) The water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to higher gas and water costs, sometimes really quickly.</p>
