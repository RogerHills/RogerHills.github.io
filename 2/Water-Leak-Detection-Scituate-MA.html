To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and steady  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration.
