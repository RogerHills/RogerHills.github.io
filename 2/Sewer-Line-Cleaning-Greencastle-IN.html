Recurring repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.

<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
