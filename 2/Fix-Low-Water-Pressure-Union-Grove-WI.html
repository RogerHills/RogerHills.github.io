<p>When the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers need to only be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
