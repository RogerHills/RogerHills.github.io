<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
