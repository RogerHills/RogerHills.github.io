<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your home. Even if the issue comes from with the local system, it's still smart to generate the specialists to limit the damage to your house.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Older toilets typically use 3.5 gallons or more per flush, especially if they were produced prior to 1994. Newer models just use 1.6 gallons per flush while still supplying the very same flushing power. More recent toilet styles are environmentally-friendly and have a dual flushing system which just utilizes 0.9 gallons per flush. Tankless hot water heater: These water heaters heat quicker than standard water heaters. They also use up less area since they don't need a tank.</p>
