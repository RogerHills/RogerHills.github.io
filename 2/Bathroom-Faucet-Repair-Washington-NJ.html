<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
