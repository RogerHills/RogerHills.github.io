Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the issue.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
