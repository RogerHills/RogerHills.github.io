<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is essential that only initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Really often the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Just insert a long, strong, wood deal with (a broom deal with will suffice) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force lowering, turn clockwise till you feel it turn easily. It may be needed to reset the disposal. Find the reset switch on the bottom of the unit if so. Use any type of drain cleaner to release it if the clog persists.</p>
