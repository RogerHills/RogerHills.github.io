<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on dry or wet sprinkler systems unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>So, if you want to stop having to wiggle your toilet deal with every time you flush and are sick and tired of posting polite check in your bathroom everytime you have people over, get a new trip lever that in fact works for your toilet.
