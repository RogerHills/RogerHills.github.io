<p>The majority of sink problems are repairable. It can last for years and may only need replacement once a kitchen is remodelled if a sink is properly taken care of.

Local plumber quoted cost of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I examined around. Under the sink, position a pail or pan below the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
