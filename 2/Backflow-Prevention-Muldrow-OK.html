<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners offer these days. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Service providers then typically blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your home was built before the 1970s or hasn't been renovated, you will more than likely have old pipes that need replacing.</p>
<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
