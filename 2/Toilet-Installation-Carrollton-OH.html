<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Carrollton OH</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>

Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
