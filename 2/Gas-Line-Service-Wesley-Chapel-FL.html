Water pressure may be or stop working minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks.
