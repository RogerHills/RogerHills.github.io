<p>To repair and replace a gas line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Repairing a gas line is really replacing a gas line - if it's malfunctioning it needs to be replaced. The cost of gas line replacement is figured out by the cost of labor and materials. The variation of the cost depends on whether the task is an easy gas leak repair or a complete replacement of the gas line system. Additional gas line installation for brand-new home appliances are charged independently.</p>
<p>When the water softening does not occur it might also indicate softener breakdown, or a problem with the salt that is used. In the house stores, the majority of Badger 5 disposals can be bought for about $99-150. With Bill Howe's additional service warranty, with installation, consumers are looking at around $325. The Development Series and other high horsepower heavy-duty disposals with quiet functions normally start at $300 and up simply for the disposal.</p>
