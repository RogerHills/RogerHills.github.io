<p>Concealed water leakages are often demanding and have Potentially Severe Consequences. Replacing your flapper may require slightly different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up tough water.</p>

<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll discover that water goes to fill up the bowl. However, in an appropriately working toilet, the water must stop running when the bowl is filled to its appropriate capacity. If your toilet continues to run, chances are you have an internal leak and water is being dumped down the overflow. These leakages are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>If a clogged drain is left uncontrolled, it can easily end up being a plumbing emergency for your house. At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning we provide 24-hour emergency assistance for circumstances like burst pipes triggered by blockages. Detach the waste disposal unit, if you're saving it. How the disposal is linked to the sink differs based upon brand name and type. Refer to your product instructions or call the maker if you need guidance. The disposal will usually be connected to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
