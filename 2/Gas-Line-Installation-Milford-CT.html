<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

If you do have regular leaks, we discover that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and better long-lasting solution.</p>
