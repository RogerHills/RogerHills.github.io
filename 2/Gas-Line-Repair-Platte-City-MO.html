<p>When deciding on the proper system security there are a number of factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be looked at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be really various, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to meet that particular hazard or need. An aircraft garage will need a really different fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also differ considerably.</p>
