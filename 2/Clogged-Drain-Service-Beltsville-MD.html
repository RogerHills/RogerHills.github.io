<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were really responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did a remarkable task.

Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still an issue that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
