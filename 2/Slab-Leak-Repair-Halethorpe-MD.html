<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
