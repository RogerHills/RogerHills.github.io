I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
