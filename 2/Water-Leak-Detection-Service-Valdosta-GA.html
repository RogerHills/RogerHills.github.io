Over time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon approximately helps eliminate the sediment. If you spot a leak and select a patching job rather of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the same material and they may be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
