<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home.

Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
