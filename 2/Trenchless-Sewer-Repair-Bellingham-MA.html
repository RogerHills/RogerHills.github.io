<p>The next action we must perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
