<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most widespread and destructive water problems: hard water.  Hard water ruined the modern home. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale considerably reduces the life-span of appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice machines. Difficult water damages warm water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
