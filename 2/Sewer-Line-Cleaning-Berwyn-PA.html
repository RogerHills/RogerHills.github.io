<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Berwyn PA</h3>

<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
