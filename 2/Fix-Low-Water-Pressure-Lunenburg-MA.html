I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
