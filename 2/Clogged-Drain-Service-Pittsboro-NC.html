Here's whatever you need to know before rolling up your sleeves, directly from the pros.</p>
<p>You need to invest a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a durable surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be bothersome.

<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation might still occur.</p>
