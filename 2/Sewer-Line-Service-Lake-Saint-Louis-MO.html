<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Lake Saint Louis MO</h3>
<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to offering a comprehensive line of backflow preventers, most of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing components meet and exceed the standards developed by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free effort. Current modifications to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are directly planned for human water usage are required to be produced with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass material. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have been designated lead-free," indicating they are certified.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to restore and enter the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
