<p>2. When they sense their softening capacity is low as determined by a predetermined number gotten in by the user, demand-initiated softeners regenerate. The predetermined number represents the amount of time between each regeneration. For instance, a lower picked number implies your softener will regenerate less frequently. If you are experiencing spots, try choosing a lower number up until you discover one that meets your requirements. Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and efficient than time-initiated softeners.</p>
