<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

If your disposal is clogged, don't use severe drain cleaning chemicals to attempt to unclog the system. Chemicals can harm the mechanical parts, reducing the life of the disposal.
