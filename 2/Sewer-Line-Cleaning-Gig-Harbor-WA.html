<p>Water softeners been available in all shapes and sizes and larger absolutely does not indicate much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that in fact provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable maximum capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our trademarked Directional Flow Screen system assists guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also secure the resin bed, so we do not need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regrowth to release sediment, dirt and solidity.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
