<p>Many softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's wise to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to preserve the system.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually required numerous repairs over the last few years. A great general rule for water heaters is this: since the life expectancy of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water flows easily from the sink drain into your container, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is most likely even more down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your home can damage floors, woodworking, and other valuable items such as cabinets. Left ignored, leaking sewer water can cause mold and much more severe structural damage. If overlooked, leaking sewer water from your main home drain or house sewer can also trigger substantial damage.</p>
