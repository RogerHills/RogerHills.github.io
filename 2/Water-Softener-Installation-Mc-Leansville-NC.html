<p>Visible odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your home or organisation place, give us a call. That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be replaced rather than repaired.
