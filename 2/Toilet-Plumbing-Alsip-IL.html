For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of deterioration control. Therefore, thinking about all these aspects, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
