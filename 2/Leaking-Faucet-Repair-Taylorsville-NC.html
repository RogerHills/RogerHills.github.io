<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
