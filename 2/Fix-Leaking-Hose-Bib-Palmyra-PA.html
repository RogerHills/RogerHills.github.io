If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
