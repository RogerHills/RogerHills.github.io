If the water heater has been preserved with yearly flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic service warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>The customer has thirty days to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Most of the time, a professional plumber can come out and discover the issue and make the repairs. In some circumstances, the toilet might be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is needed.</p>
