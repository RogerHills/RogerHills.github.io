Dissolved calcium and magnesium precipitate out of tough water as scale, which develops on the insides of pipes, water heaters, tea kettles, coffee machine and industrial equipment. Scale reduces flow through pipes and is a bad conductor of heat. Ultimately, pipes can become entirely clogged.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
