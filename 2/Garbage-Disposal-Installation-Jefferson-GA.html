<p>Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing supplies repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, along with cities and towns in the surrounding metro. If you discover rusty water, rumbling or banging sounds coming from your hot water heater's tank, an increased amount of time needed to warm your water, or puddles of water under your hot water heater, it's time to call the professionals about repair or replacement choices.</p>
<p>Release piping connected to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or damp sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>

Depending upon the intensity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger may be required.
