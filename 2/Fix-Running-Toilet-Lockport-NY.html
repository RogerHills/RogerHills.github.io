Some disposer systems do not come with a power cord connected. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Make certain to purchase a wiring set with the proper power score and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you link the wiring harness to the disposer, guarantee the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable.</p>

To utilize a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap beneath the sink, making certain it is not clogged prior to proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the deal with in a clockwise direction and push the auger forward at the very same time.
