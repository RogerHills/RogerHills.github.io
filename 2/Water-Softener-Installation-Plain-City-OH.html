Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>
