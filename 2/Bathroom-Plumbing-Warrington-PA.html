<p>Water hardness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.
