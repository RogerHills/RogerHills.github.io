Each and every installation should be looked at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be developed and installed to fulfill that specific risk or need. An aircraft garage will need a really various fire protection system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also vary considerably.</p>
