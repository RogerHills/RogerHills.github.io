<p>The next action we must perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
