<p>The simplest way to keep you and your household safe from the prospective hazards of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical house get consistent use. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other debris can slowly build up in time. The drain will slowly slow till it ends up being completely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in stores have restricted efficiency.

<p>A few of the reasons for drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or too much food being disposed down the drain. We will typically recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the circumstance. Offer us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells nasty, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
