To prevent rust from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod secures the tank by bring in damaging materials. By having the anode rod checked routinely and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>

Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
