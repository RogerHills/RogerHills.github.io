<p>Difficult water causes a greater threat of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the effectiveness of hot boilers and tanks is reduced. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) presses against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pushing it closed.</p>
<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining a gallon approximately helps remove the sediment. If you identify a leak and choose a patching task rather of a repiping task, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the exact same product and they might be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your entire house when you find a leak.</p>
