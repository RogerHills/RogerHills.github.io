<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
