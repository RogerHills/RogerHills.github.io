Your local Culligan Man will review the firmness of your water, the size of your household and even your house's plumbing before suggesting the best water softening service for you and your budget. All plumbing and gasfitting work requires a permit and inspection. To set up, reschedule, cancel or inquire about an inspection, call 410-887-4638 or use Inspection Connection and follow the prompts. Please have your authorization number and three-digit inspection code ready. Inspections may be scheduled up until 8 p.m. for the next day.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water system into the general public water supply. This can happen at any time, such as throughout a water main break or during a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe consist of rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily mean repiping is the only option. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the issue to determine the very best course of action.</p>
