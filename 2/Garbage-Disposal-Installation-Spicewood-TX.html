<p>New England Pipe Restoration is the premier sewer repair provider in the Northeast. While this might look like a problem with your faucet, it's typically brought on by something else - like a plumbing problem or problem with your hot water heater.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately experiences rust and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

It's being stunned by a live wire while under a sink if there's anything even worse than being surprised by a live wire.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
