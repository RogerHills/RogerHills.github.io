<p>Woodbury, in addition to many other neighborhoods and companies, has actually discovered the very best method to prevent these stains from occurring is by reducing the variety of times your water softener restores. "Restoring" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "exhausted" or complete.
