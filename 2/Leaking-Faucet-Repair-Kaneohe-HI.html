<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these aspects, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
