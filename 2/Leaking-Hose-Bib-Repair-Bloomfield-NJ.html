<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>While gas leaks are not as common as other plumbing problems they still occur.

If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet.
