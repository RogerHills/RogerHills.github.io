For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.

<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.
