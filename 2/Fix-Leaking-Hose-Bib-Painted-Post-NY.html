<p>Borax beings in the precise same family of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a speeding up water softener and it comes with the same disadvantages i.e. skin irritation and build-up. If either of these disadvantages are unacceptable to you - you'll wish to discover what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Switch on the water to fill the toilet tank. Pinch the spring clip and move the float up or down to set the water level 1 in. listed below the top of the overflow tube or to the water line marked on the tank.</p>
