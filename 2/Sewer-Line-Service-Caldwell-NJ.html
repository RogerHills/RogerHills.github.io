<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If allowed to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
