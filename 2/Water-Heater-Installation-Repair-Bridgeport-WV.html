<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive choice.</p>
