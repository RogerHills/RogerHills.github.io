<p>Because the copper pipes have actually not had a possibility to become layered inside, New houses developed with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to corrosive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>Backflow preventers must just be fixed when the information gathered from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
