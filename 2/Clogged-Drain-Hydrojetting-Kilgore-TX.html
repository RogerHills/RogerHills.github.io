<p>Many houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
