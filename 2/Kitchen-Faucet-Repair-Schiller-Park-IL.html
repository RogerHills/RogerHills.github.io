<p>Marin WATER is a professional plumbing and water treatment specialist situated in San Rafael, CA. We happily serve residential and commercial clients throughout Marin County, California. Does your water taste bad? Does it leave a milky residue on your components and counters? No matter what problems you're having with your tap water, RainSoft has the best service.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
