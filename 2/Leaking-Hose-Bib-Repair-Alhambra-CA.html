<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water, backpressure is created. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective pollutants can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The best method to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
