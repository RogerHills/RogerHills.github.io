<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. Over time, like any other device in your house, your waste disposal unit. may need repairs. A disposal system may start or clog to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, use. A leak somewhere in the system may suggest a worn seal. In many cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the entire system. This is where the UPC truly enters into play. There are specific rules for where black iron gas pipes can be utilized, and where they can not. If utilized in an incorrect place, it can end up being an extremely severe security threat.</p>
