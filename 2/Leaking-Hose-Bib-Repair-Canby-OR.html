<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it concerns pipe repair, the most costly aspects aren't the equipment or products used, but the landscaping, uprooting and lawn damage that occurs.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
