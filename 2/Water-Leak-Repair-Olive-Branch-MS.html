<p>As explained earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home must have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the correct locations. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are typically sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
