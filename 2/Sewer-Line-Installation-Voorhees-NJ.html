<p>However, because a garbage disposal is only expected to last between 10 to 12 years, a replacement will eventually be essential. This is specifically true for disposals that are utilized frequently because their blades will rapidly become dull. Another time that a replacement will be necessary is when the motor stops working completely.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided exceptional service for us in replacing an extremely balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not only was he extremely professional and extensive but he had the ability to respond to all my questions concerning the service. I would give 6 stars if I could.

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to offer some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.
