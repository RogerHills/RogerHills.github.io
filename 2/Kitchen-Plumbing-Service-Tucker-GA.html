<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If enabled to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
