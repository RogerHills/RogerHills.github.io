<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is very little insulation in the weaker designs. Here are some common types of waste disposal unit you may want to think about. There are usually two kinds of disposals: aluminum and stainless-steel. Aluminum disposals are the most cost-effective, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are susceptible to corrosion and leaking.</p>
<p>A lot of houses or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>If a clogged drain is left unchecked, it can quickly end up being a plumbing emergency for your house. At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & A/c we provide 24-hour emergency support for situations like burst pipes brought on by clogs. Disconnect the waste disposal unit, if you're waiting. How the disposal is connected to the sink differs based on brand name and type. If you need guidance, refer to your item directions or contact the maker. The disposal will typically be linked to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
