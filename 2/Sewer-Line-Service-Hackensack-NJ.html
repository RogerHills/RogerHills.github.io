<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the right side of one of the lugs in the mounting ring.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
