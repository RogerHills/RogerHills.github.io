<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at La Crescenta CA</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
