<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try dumping a tray of ice down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or exhausted, broken sink? No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing team does the job quickly and economically.</p>
<p>In addition to the waste disposal unit system, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you might need to consider when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
