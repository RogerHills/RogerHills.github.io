<p>Tru-Soft Â® Solar Brine Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener systems. Current Review: Howard, the Job Manager, has actually constantly been handy and helpful relating to all our concerns. He did the proposal and set up the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair promptly. It is always a satisfaction to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly pleasant, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- usually salt. The result is water that's been effectively softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>

<p>Every day, the drains in your house effectively eliminate big amounts of water and waste. Over time, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other small particles can get caught and build up in your pipes.
