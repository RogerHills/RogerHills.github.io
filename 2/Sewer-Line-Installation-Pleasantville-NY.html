<p>Surprise water leaks are frequently difficult and have Potentially Serious Repercussions. Replacing your flapper might need a little different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve.
