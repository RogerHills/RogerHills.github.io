After eliminating standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mixture.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the inherent style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an exceptionally low circulation or fixed flow condition might trigger problem dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
