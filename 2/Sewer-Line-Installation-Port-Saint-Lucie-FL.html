If you discover rusty water, rumbling or banging sounds coming from your hot water heater's tank, an increased amount of time required to warm your water, or puddles of water under your hot water heater, it's time to call the professionals about repair or replacement alternatives.</p>
<p>Two designs of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve.

<p>Water heaters are looked for any indications of leaks, rust, or damage. If appropriate, all gas lines need to be examined as well.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
