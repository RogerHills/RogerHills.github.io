<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>When the water softening does not occur it could also show softener malfunction, or a problem with the salt that is applied. In the house stores, a lot of Badger 5 disposals can be purchased for about $99-150. With Bill Howe's extra service warranty, with installation, consumers are looking at roughly $325.
