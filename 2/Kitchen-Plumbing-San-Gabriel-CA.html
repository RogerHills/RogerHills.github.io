<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
