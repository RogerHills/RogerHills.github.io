<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest style of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least costly, however also the least reliable option.

When one has actually failed, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to spot.</p>

Fire defense system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the places they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be developed and set up to fulfill that particular threat or need.
