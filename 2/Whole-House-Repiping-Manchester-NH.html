<p>Other pipe repair methods include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a projected lifespan of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
