Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our customers is kept free from harmful impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices containing a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection.

This can happen through a process called backflow.</p>
<p>The toilet takes a truly long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of lowered pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is designed to release and open water to the outdoors, making sure backflow never takes place.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
