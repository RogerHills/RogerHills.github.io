<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Manchester MD</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
