<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Camp Lejeune NC</h3>

Salt ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, complimentary" salt ions are released into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends upon the solidity of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to eliminate firmness.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI.
