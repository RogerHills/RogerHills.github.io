While a high quality, high horse power disposal can grind and press practically anything down the kitchen sink, it does not imply it's good for the pipes. Gas shut-off valve installation costs between $52 and $138 per appliance, including labor and products. Materials cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour.

<p>Use the useful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free.

If the leak isn't found soon, apparently it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
