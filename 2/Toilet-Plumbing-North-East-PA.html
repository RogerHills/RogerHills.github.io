<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
