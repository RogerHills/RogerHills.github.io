<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Old Hickory TN</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their duties break out into two categories: Plumbers who manage standard repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who concentrate on renovating additions and projects.</p>
<p>Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters complete an apprenticeship program and pass the needed licensing exam to become journey-level employees. Journey-level plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters are qualified to carry out jobs separately. Plumbers with a number of years of plumbing experience who pass another exam make master status. Some states require master plumber status in order to get a plumbing contractor's license.</p>
