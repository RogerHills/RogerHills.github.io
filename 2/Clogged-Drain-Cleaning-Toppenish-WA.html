<p>If these combinations aren't effective in unclogging your sink, grab a common household plunger. First seal off the second side with a wet cloth or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger securely over the drain and plunge vigorously a number of times. Remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
