In some cases, however, the damage is so comprehensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is merely a more practical alternative. This generally involves fractures in the toilet bowl itself, extensive rust over numerous elements, or simply due to the fact that you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
