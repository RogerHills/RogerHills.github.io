<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps record wetness and sediment so that they do not enter the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that could enable tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These devices go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In most cases, they are subject to regular tests later on, as well.</p>
