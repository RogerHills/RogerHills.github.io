<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Wilmington NC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
