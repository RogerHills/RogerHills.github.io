<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the factor you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
<p>In general, toilets are quite basic to repair and run. Almost any part can be removed and replaced reasonably quickly and rapidly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has an issue, the stakes are high. Harmed toilets can do some genuinely comprehensive, pricey, and ... smelly damage to a home.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
