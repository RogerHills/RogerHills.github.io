It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate when this happens.</p>

If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
