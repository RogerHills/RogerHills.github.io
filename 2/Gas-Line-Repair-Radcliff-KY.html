"Restoring" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. However, many water softeners regenerate frequently, when the filter medium actually isn't complete. This can be fixed by merely resetting your water softener to get rid of less solidity or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>
