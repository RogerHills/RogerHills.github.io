Before entering into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to understand how a toilet works.  Most homes in the US, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is described as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal deteriorates in time permitting water to escape into the toilet bowl, thus decreasing the amount of water in the tank readily available for a flush.

<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
