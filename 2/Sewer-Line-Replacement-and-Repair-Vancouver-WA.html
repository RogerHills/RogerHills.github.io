<p>If you choose to attempt this job yourself, be prepared to keep careful track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none fall down the drain).

Repairing a leaking fuel line is a simple job for a repair center and expenses between $60 and $120. Lavacot says it can easily be done in the house by the semi-advanced mechanic. When water is warmed, hard water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash market. Typically, the cost savings have been based largely on reducing chemical and cleaning agent costs. While those savings are still substantial, new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) also provides significant water and salt cost savings.</p>
