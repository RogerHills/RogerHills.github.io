<p>In some cases, our specialists will recommend that you replace your water heater instead of purchase repairs.

That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a color test.</p>

<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in Marcus Hook PA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
