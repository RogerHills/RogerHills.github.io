<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A permit is not required for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>

<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
