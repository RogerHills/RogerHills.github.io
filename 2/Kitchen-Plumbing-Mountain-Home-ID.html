<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and responsibility are incredibly crucial to building a credibility for quality. One common method for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread out greatly. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
