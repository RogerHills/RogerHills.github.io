<p>Every day, the drains in your house efficiently eliminate large quantities of water and waste. With time, dirt, particles, hair, and many other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Ultimately, the water may not be able to drain rapidly or efficiently, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously backing up. It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate when this happens.</p>
<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has needed numerous repairs over the last few years. A great guideline for water heaters is this: since the life-span of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
