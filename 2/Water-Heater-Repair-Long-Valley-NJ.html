<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our customers is kept free from harmful pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water supply. This can happen through a procedure referred to as backflow.</p>
<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners offer nowadays. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Service providers then typically blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your house was built prior to the 1970s or hasn't been renovated, you will probably have old pipes that need replacing.</p>
