Both are worth considering for your kitchen, but those benefits are only offered to those who purchase quality units that are also installed by a professional plumber. Too often we see disposal systems destroyed by improper installation. Taking a faster way by installing it yourself can often result in an absence of performance and regular repairs down the line.</p>
