When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is split, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed with time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely broken and just requires to be replaced.</p>

<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
