<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the outside.

For this reason, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>

All new replacement pipes have a projected life-span of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another effective strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a hardening lining product which coats the within the existing pipe, a new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
