<p>Badly installed gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>

If whatever is ready, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time.

A lot of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
