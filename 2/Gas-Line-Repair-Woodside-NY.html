<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
