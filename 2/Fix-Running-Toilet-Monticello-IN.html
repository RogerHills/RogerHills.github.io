<p>It's a good idea to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a few times. A drain expert like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system. Often, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and recognize the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your house, then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple locations and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
