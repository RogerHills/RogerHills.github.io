<p>Every day, the drains in your house efficiently eliminate big amounts of water and waste. In time, dirt, particles, hair, and numerous other little particles can get trapped and develop in your pipes. Ultimately, the water may not have the ability to drain quickly or efficiently, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up. It might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this takes place.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>After inspection, the work or a portion thereof shall be noted as satisfying as completed, or the authorization holder will be notified regarding where the work fails to comply with the Uniform Code.
