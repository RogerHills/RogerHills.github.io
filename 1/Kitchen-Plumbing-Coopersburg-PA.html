<p>Fixing a leaky faucet looks like a simple task, however many times the situation can be stealthily made complex. Sometimes it's best to call in a certified plumber to make certain the root cause of the leak is effectively determined and addressed the very first time, rather than making a number of trips to the hardware shop and purchasing a range of parts only to wind up precisely where you started, or even worse, developing an even bigger mess. At South West Plumbing, our certified plumbers have the resources to identify the source of the leak and get it repaired for you. They can also inspect your existing faucets and sinks to prevent future leaks.</p>

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
