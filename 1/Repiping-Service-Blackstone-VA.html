<p>Offering quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>You wish to save water. Older toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer models. U.S. Epa's WaterSense toilets utilize less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Replacing your toilet with a brand-new design can save countless gallons of water - minimizing your utility bills and helping the environment.</p>

<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water supply. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow.
