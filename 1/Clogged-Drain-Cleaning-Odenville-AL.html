<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
