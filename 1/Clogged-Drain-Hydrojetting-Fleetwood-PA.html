<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
