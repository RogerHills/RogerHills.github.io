When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can trigger obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might result in substantial home damage. Look out for wet, green patches in your backyard, a relentless sewage smell in or around your home, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all common indications of root intrusion.</p>
<p>Really frequently the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply place a long, strong, wooden handle (a broom manage will be adequate) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force lowering, rotate clockwise up until you feel it turn freely. It may be essential to reset the disposal. If so, find the reset switch on the bottom of the system. Use any type of drain cleaner to release it if the clog persists.</p>
