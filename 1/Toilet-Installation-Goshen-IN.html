Backsiphonage takes place when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water supply into the public water supply.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
