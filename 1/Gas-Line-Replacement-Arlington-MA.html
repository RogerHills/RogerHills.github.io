<p>Backflow preventers are vital for developing a safe water supply system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be correctly maintained. The salt water service should be blended and kept in the brine tank. Routine blocking of the resin likewise needs unique attention.

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most prevalent and disastrous water problems: tough water.  Hard water ruined the modern-day house. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the lifespan of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice devices.
