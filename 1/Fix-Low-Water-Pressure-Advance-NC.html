When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, along with examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
