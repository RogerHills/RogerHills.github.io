The provider need to get an authorization before trenching. How frequently a backflow preventer needs to be evaluated depends upon its type. There are 2 main sort of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and minimized pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most frequently used in commercial centers.</p>

Double check with your representative to verify that your understanding is correct once you have actually read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
