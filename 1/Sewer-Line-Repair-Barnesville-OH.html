<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high danger of coming into contact with toxins due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout.

Including air in this method preserves consistent water pressure, which causes the fixture to utilize less water.</p>
