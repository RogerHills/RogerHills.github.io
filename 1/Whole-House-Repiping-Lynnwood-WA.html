<p>In most cases, the toilet can be fixed rather than replaced, because the concern typically comes down to a single element or 2. Sometimes, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is merely a more useful alternative. This generally involves cracks in the toilet bowl itself, extensive rust over several elements, or just since you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>The easiest solution might appear to be merely overlooking the issue or utilizing a do it yourself chemical option. Nevertheless, this is a momentary fix and may cause more damage.
