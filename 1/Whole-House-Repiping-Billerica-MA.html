<p>The process of regeneration can use 25 gallons of water or more daily, or approximately 10,000 gallons per year.

WaterSense believes there is a chance to profit from this water savings opportunity, raise customer awareness, and further enhance the efficiency of water softeners.</p>
<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
