<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Sellersville PA</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
