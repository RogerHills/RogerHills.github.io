The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a projected life expectancy of one a century and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another efficient strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a hardening lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
