<p>The Battelle Research study also discovered difficult water to rapidly result in clogged shower heads, sometimes after as low as a year and a half of routine usage. After just one week of consistent testing with tough water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles ended up being clogged, according to lab results. Shower heads using water treated by a water softening system, on the other hand, performed almost as well as on the day they were set up.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>We've detailed the procedure we suggest for discovering a good plumber. Now let's take a look at the services a great plumber ought to provide. Detach the drain trap from the discharge tube. If required, disconnect the disposal from the dishwasher connection. Louisville has a few of the hardest water in the nation, so it is very important to think about including a water softener to your home.
