When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system.

For obstructions that occur further down the pipe, utilize a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged prior to proceeding.
