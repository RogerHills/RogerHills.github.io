<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close.

Obviously it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't found quickly.</p>
