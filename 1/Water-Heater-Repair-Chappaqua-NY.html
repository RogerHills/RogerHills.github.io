But if your toilet is showing any of the following signs, it might be time to replace it. We evaluate backflow requirements for services on a specific basis when a water account is developed. After removing standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>
