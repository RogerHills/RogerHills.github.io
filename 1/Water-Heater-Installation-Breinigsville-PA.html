<p>Will not drain - The unit might not be chopping food correctly and waste may have clogged the drain pipe.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are set up in areas where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices.

Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
