Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
