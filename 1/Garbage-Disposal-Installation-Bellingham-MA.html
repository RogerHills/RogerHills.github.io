<p>As described earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide gas is entirely odor-free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home must have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the appropriate areas. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are usually sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>

If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
