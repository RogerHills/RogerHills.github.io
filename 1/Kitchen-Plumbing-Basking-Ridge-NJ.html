In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually required multiple repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it replaced.

It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
