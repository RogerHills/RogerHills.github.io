When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
