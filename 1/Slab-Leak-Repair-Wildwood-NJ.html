If your pipes are gurgling or producing foul smells, you'll understand this.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
