<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>

After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, since I never wish to see this company again.</p>
