<p>And so, we see the transition from big transportation pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to entire cities to large distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller communities or large facilities, to medium circulation pipelines and finally to small service pipelines. Each phase in the water supply and circulation system has to handle varying circulation rates, flow velocities and pressure heads, along with different levels of exposure to possible backwash or contaminant infiltration and the subsequent need for security with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Read your insurance policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working. Ensure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Numerous insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied because the standard HO-3 house owners' policy particularly leaves out "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance agent and validate your coverage. When you have read through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is right.</p>
