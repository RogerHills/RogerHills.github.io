Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however chances are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>An approved backflow prevention assembly should be installed on each safe and clean water service connection to any premises containing specific kinds of centers.

Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement.

Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A waste disposal unit is an important kitchen device in a lot of homes today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can deal with practically any kind of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other things jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the risk of drain blockages.</p>
