<p>As discussed earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide is totally odorless and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house needs to have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the proper areas. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are usually sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
