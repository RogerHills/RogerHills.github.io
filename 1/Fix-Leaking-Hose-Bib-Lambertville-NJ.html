Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and preventing putting any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases obstructions are unavoidable. If you have a clogged drain, it is exceptionally important that you do not attempt to unclog it yourself because this might possibly result in a large leak and more expensive repairs.</p>
