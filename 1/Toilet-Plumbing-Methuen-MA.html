<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>This is the traditional question that lots of homeowners ask themselves. Is it better to repair their pipes or repipe them and start fresh? The response is entirely based on your special scenario. For example, if your pipe is experiencing a small leak but is in otherwise excellent condition, we would advise fixing it. However, if the pipe is constantly leaking and needs regular repairs, we would suggest repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never ever suggest services or products that would not genuinely benefit the client.</p>

<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Methuen MA</h3>
<p>Water softeners leakages are mostly triggered because of a problem at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced gradually. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is likely split and merely needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
