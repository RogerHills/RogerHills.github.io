<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in Reno NV?</h3>
<p>When your hot water heater starts to leak, you need to replace it quickly. We'll show you how to install your own gas hot water heater in less than a day. Even if you do not need a new water heater today, opportunities are you will within the next few years. Water heaters tend to last 7 to 15 years. If yours is getting old, this post is likewise for you. If you're handy with basic tools and have a bit of experience soldering copper, replacing a water heater isn't challenging.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
