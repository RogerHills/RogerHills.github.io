<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
