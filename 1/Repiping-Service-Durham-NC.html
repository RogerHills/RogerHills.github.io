<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
