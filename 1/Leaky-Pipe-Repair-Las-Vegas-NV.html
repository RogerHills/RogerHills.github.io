<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
