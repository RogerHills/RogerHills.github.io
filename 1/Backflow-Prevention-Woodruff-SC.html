<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, including bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have actually been enabled to freeze.</p>
