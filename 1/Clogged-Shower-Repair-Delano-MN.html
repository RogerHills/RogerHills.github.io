<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
