<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Calistoga CA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both locations. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a newly set up backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer checked on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
