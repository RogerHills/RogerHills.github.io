The material has actually highly established structure of pores on the surface of which are sites with easily trapped and released ions. This process of trapping of ions happens with a simultaneous releasing of other ions resulting in the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be made to selectively choose one, or perhaps several different kinds of ions. Usually, these resins are based on cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
