<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>There are two types of products utilized to develop a garbage disposal system: aluminum and stainless steel. The typical cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel waste disposal unit has an average cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously challenging to trace, especially on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll want to work with somebody who will trace the issue at its origin.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
