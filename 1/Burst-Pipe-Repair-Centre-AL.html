<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
