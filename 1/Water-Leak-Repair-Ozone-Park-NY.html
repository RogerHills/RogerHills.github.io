Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood.
