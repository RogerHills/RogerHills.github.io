Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
