Mr. Singh did a minimum of three attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl.

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to business? The timing of regeneration depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water in fact needs it. When needed, newer systems use computerized sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water use and therefore only regrow. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
