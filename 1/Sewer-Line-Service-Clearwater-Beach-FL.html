<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller sized model that operated on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes.
