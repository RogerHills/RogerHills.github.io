<p>Know that softened water contains trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the very same quantity of salt as a slice of bread. That's not quite salt, however for those on a strict sodium-free diet it might be excessive. If this does not work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's parts, generally the flapper. There may likewise be an issue with the chain attached to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
<h3>Sewer Pipe Repair in New Freedom Pennsylvania</h2>
