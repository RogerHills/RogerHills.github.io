<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try in Plymouth Meeting PA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
