<p>Every day, the drains in your home efficiently get rid of large quantities of water and waste. Gradually, dirt, debris, hair, and numerous other little particles can get caught and develop in your pipes. Ultimately, the water may not have the ability to drain quickly or effectively, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly supporting. It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this takes place.</p>
<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is necessary to pinpoint the specific area of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. Just sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the problem. The specialists and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance real estate agent, company or city inspector.</p>
