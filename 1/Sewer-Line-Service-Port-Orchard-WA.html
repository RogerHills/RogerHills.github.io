<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is comprised of numerous mechanical parts which, with time, undergo wear and tear and may need to be changed.

<p>Many houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals moderately. Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
