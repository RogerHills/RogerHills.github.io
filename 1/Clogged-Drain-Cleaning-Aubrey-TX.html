<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are particularly prone to destructive water conditions since the copper pipes have not had a possibility to become coated within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
