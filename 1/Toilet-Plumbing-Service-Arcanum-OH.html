When either temperature or pressure surpasses predetermined levels, they likewise feature a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens. We supply gas hot water heater service, in addition to electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
<p>Release piping connected to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve.
