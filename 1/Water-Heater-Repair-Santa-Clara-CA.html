<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house.
