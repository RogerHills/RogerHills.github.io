<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to service? The timing of regeneration depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water actually needs it. When needed, newer systems use electronic sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and therefore only regenerate. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect because they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>

<p>When the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its performance below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers must only be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer.

These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
