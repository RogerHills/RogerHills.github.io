<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will lead to decapitation, it may terrify a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can purchase models with special functions that do whatever but add the salt, you will pay for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique feature will not fail. Depending on the water source, you may need to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic system, you need to consider the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This might or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will normally advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the circumstance. Offer us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
