When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause blockages, breaks, and back-ups which might result in substantial property damage. Look out for damp, green spots in your yard, a persistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all common signs of root invasion.</p>
