Difficult water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these symptoms.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).
