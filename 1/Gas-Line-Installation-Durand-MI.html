<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your security, convenience, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is very crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can break or deteriorate.

If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
