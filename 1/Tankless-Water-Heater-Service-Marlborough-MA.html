<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
