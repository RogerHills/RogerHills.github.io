Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>
