<p>If these mixes aren't effective in unclogging your sink, reach for a typical household plunger. First seal off the 2nd side with a wet fabric or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with adequate water to cover the bell of the plunger.
