<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Phoenixville PA?</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
