<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
