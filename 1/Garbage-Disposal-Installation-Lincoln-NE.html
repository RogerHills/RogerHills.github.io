<p>Making use of backflow preventers is tied to the water's use. Backflow preventers are used to make sure the security and pureness of the distributed water. Commercial supply of water typically has a minimum requirement of quality, depending on the commercial procedure in concern. Farming on the other hand has less strict water quality requirements.
