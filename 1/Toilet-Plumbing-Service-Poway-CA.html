<h3>Clogged Sink Repair  in Poway California</h2>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>She understood about the service call cost. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation found that's a common cost. Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would provide a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation prior to dedicating to a price, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
