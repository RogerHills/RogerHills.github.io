<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
