Lots of insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims may be denied since the basic HO-3 house owners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance coverage agent and confirm your coverage. As soon as you have read through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to validate that your understanding is proper.</p>
