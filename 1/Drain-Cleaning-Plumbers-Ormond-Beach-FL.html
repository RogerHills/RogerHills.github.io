<p>Inspections prevent a high portion of plumbing emergencies. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to help it run appropriately. It is essential to make sure there is always two feet of clearance around it. You should also drain about 25 percent of your tank frequently (a couple of times each year). This will help remove any sediment that has settled inside the tank.</p>
<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a big storage tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and after that released into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank includes the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you go beyond a preset level. You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
