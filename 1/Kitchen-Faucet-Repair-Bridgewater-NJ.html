<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Bridgewater NJ</h3>

Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
