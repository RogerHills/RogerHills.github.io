Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" sodium ions are released into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to remove firmness.</p>
<p>We've got the experience and big job capability to handle plumbing remodels of every size and scope, including main water line repiping, sewer line replacement, slab leak repair, and more. This course is for students that have worked a minimum of 4,000 hours under a North Carolina licensed plumber and are prepared to acquire their license.
