<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did an awesome task.

Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
