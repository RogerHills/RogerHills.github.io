"Regenerating" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "tired" or complete. However, many water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium really isn't full. This can be corrected by simply resetting your water softener to remove less solidity or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>

The resultant gap breaks any prospective siphon before it can occur, preventing infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers.
