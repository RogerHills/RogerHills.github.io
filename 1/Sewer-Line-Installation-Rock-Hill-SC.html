<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide Rock Hill SC</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
