When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
