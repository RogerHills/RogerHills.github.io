<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Blanchard OK</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
