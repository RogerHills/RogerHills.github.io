<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
