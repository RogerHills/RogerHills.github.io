<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket.

A number of homes in my community being repiped and have actually spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't detected quickly, apparently it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause significant damage.</p>
