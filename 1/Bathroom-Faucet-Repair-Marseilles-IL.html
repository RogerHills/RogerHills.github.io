<p>This is a totally valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as important as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. However, it includes a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably little cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>

Changing a toilet can upgrade the entire appearance of your bathroom. A professional plumber can make it all right. He or she has the right devices, including high-pressure jets, to locate the blockages and clear the pipes, permitting the free flow of water again.</p>

That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace.

The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
