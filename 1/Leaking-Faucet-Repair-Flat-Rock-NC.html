<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Flat Rock NC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
