<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a component, sub-system, or system group is replaced, an authorization and inspection will not be required. This shall not prevent the licensee from acquiring authorizations and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>
<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has required several repairs over the last couple of years. A great general rule for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>

Whenever you renovate a portion of your home, seize the day to check-- and if need be, replace-- any plumbing lines that you expose when you open the walls and floorings.
