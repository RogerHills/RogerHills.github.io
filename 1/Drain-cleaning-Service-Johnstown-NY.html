<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be properly maintained. The brine option should be combined and stored in the salt water tank. Periodic clogging of the resin likewise needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, bacteria and fungis also form mats in the resin that minimize its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. Nevertheless, read the producer's directions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
