<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market.
