<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet ought to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
<p>There is no element of modern plumbing that we depend on to the very same degree as a correctly working toilet. Whether your current toilet needs repairs or you wish to install a newer, more environmentally friendly toilet, our Fredericksburg, VA plumbers can assist. We are dedicated to serving the requirements of households throughout Virginia. A final inspection after all work licensed by the plumbing authorization has been finished.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
