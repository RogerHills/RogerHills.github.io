<p>Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
