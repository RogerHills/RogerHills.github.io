<p>When choosing the appropriate system security there are numerous factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be looked at on an individual basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be created and installed to fulfill that particular threat or need. An airplane hangar will need a very different fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also vary considerably.</p>
