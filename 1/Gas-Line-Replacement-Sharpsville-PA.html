<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a fixture, system, or sub-system  group is replaced, an authorization and inspection will not be required. This shall not preclude the licensee from obtaining authorizations and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not secured utilizing the required solvent cement (end of the pipe ought to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe.
