When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>Softeners primarily eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial red flag that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
