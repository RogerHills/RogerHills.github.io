<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ must be installed in areas that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
