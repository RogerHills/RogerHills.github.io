<p>However, you also need to consider the age of your unit. If your system is getting near 10 years old, it's usually not wise to spend for repairs if they deserve more than half of the price of a brand-new unit. If problems end up being more frequent with an older system, then it is recommended that you have the garbage disposal changed.

<p>There are a couple of indications that will let you understand you have a gas line leak in your house, and it is very important to take note of them. The gas pipe may be pierced or damaged if you observe a strong smell that resembles rotten eggs. You may also hear a hissing sound as the gas is escaping from the line, but that isn't always the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is essential to take action rapidly to prevent any serious problems and to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
