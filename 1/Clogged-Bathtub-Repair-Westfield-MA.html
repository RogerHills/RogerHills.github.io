I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â€² hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
