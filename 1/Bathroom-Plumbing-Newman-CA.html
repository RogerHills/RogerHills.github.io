<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
