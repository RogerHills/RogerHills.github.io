<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
