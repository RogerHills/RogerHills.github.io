<p>The next action we should perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to assure the line is effectively flushed.</p>

After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company once again.</p>
