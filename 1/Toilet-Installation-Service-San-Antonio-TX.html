Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll locate among the very same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>Be aware that softened water contains trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the exact same quantity of salt as a piece of bread. That's not very much salt, however for those on a rigorous sodium-free diet it may be too much. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace among your toilet's elements, usually the flapper. There might also be an issue with the chain attached to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
