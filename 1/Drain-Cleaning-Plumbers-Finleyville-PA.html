<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
