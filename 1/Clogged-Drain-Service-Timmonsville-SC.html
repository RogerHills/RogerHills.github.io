<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. 2 FREE Toilets + Installation: Customers that request house waste repiping services will receive 2 free toilets on us, plus free setups. You may also notice inexplicably raising water expenses, which is typically the indication of a leak-- however not necessarily one that necessitates repiping. Offer our group a call and we'll more than happy to take a look at your house and see where your plumbing vulnerabilities are.</p>
<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
