<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. For over 25 years, property owners and business owners have actually relied on Good's Plumbing Heating & Air Cooling for their sewer cleaning and hot water heater replacement requirements.

<p>Aside from these two important parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
