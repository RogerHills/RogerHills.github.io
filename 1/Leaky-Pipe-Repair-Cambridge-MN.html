<p>Poorly installed gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task.

It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating & cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
