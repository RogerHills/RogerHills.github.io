The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the usage of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a forecasted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination.
