<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Wingate NC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
