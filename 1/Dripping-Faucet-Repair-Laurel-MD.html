<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Laurel MD</h3>
<p>Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio house brings minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and parts. To prevent corrosion from rust, tank are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod safeguards the tank by attracting destructive products. By having the anode rod checked regularly and changed as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
