<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
