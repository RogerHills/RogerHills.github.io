<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Plattsmouth NE</h3>
<p>With an A+ Bbb rating and a strong dedication to customer service, Epic Plumbing supplies property owners in the area with effective and reliable plumbing services.

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
