A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to separate health or non-health risks but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
