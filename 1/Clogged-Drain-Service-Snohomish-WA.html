While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can manage almost any type of food waste, they are not indestructible.

<p>Worse yet ... you arrive home after a nice night out only to discover your house or garage is flooded because from your hot water heater leaking. Master plumbers will not enable any apprentice plumber, or unlicensed journeyman plumber, in their utilize or otherwise under their supervision, to do plumbing work of any kind, including repairs and clearing interruptions of drains, unless stated master plumber is physically present and taking an active part in stated work.</p>
