<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water system system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The salt water solution need to be mixed and saved in the salt water tank. Routine blocking of the resin likewise requires special attention. For instance, if the raw supply of water is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Likewise, bacteria and fungis also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems. Nevertheless, check out the producer's instructions prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
