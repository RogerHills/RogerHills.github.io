<p>If your polybutylene pipes have stopped working, read your insurance policy thoroughly. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims may be rejected because the standard HO-3 house owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged amount of time." Call your insurance representative and confirm your protection. When you have actually read through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is right.</p>
