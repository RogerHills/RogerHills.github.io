<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
