<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and go into the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
