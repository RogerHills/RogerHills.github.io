<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or fixture  group is changed, a permit and inspection will not be needed. This shall not preclude the licensee from acquiring authorizations and inspections for such work if so wanted.</p>
<p>Backpressure may take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not properly secured, safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as many plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
