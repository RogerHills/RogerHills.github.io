<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for developing a safe water supply system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The brine option need to be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Routine blocking of the resin also needs special attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, typical backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Likewise, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. Nevertheless, read the manufacturer's guidelines before adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
