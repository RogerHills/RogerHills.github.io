If you hear the sound of air (or gas) by force leaking out of a pipe, you must follow security preventative measures and attend to the leak right away.</p>
<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge in between male and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to wiggle and jerk and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper manually. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making certain your trip lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those small everyday inconveniences - that most people simply deal with and never ever realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>
