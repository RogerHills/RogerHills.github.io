<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your safety, benefit, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is extremely essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current regulations restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer two kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
