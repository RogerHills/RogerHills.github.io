<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair in Imperial Beach CA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
