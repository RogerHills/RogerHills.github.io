<p>Waste disposal unit are a vital feature in any contemporary kitchen.

Copper pipes are eco-friendly and are resistant to breaking. However, they're likewise the most costly in this list and in areas with difficult water (like Florida) they can establish pinhole leaks.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
