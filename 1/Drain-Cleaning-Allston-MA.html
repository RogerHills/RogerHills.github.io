<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
