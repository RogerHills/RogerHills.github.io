<p>The main media contained within a water softener is called ion exchange resin. This resin is basically an insoluble matrix generally in the shape of small (1-2 mm size) beads. The product has extremely established structure of pores on the surface area of which are sites with quickly trapped and launched ions.

Ion exchange resins can be produced to selectively choose one, or perhaps numerous different kinds of ions. Normally, these resins are based upon cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
