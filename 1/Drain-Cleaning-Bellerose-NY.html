If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was built decades before that, opportunities are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at ideal rates.</p>
