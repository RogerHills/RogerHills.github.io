<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Waterloo IL</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Energy Performance. Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is recommended. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is shown by its Energy Element (EF). The more effective the water heater the higher the EF rating. However, just because a hot water heater has a higher EF value, it doesn't always indicate it will have lower operating expense. You likewise have to think about the fuel source.</p>
