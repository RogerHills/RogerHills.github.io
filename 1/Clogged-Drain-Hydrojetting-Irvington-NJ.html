<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Irvington New Jersey</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the newly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
