<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps capture wetness and sediment so that they don't go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap may be consisted of in a drip leg install.

<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if suitable).
