<p>With the seriousness of plumbing problems being equal, you may be much better off replacing your toilet if it is an older model. Older toilets frequently abide by more lax guidelines in terms of water use, so a more recent toilet may wind up saving you money every month.

<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up effectively, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
