<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of deterioration control. Therefore, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
