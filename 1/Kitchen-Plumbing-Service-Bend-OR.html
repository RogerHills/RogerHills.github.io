<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can buy models with special features that do everything but include the salt, you will spend for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm assurance that the unique feature will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit.

Scalding water is generally the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and need to be instantly addressed by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
