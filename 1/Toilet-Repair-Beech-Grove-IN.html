<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
