<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak undesirable problems on your property.

<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Picture 1. Water is likely escaping through a cracked or rusted overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper does not stop the running sound.
