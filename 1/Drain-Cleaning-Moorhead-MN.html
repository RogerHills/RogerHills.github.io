If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
