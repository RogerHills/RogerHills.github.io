<p>It may be time to get it changed if your water heater has actually needed several repairs over the last couple of years. A great guideline for water heaters is this: because the life expectancy of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
