<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Dos Palos California</h2>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve.
