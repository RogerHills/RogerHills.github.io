<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Caldwell ID</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
