<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. . It may seem practically impossible to monitor such a deeply underground system. Maintenance, on an underground system, might appear null and void when your plumbing is over forty years of ages. In older houses, it can be challenging to know if your plumbing is sluggish due to the fact that it's old, or if it's slow due to the fact that it's clogged drain Atlanta, GA.

<p>The typical option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
