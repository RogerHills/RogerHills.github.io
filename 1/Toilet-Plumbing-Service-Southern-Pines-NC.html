<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
