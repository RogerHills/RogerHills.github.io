<p>Therefore, we see the shift from substantial transport pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to entire cities to big distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller sized neighborhoods or large centers, to medium distribution pipelines and finally to little service pipelines. Each phase in the water supply and distribution system needs to deal with varying circulation rates, circulation velocities and pressure heads, along with various levels of exposure to potential backwash or contaminant seepage and the subsequent need for protection with backflow preventers.</p>
