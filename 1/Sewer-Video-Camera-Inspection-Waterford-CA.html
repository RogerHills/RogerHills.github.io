<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
