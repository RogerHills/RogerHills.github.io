<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Take a close take a look at the galvanized pipes on the right. After just a few years the inside of the pipe will begin state to rust This abrasive and filthy sediment will end up being transported throughout your houses whole plumbing system.
