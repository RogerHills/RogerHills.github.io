<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Westwood NJ</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
