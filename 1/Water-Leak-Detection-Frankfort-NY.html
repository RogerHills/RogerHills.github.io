Most houses in the United States, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.  This seal deteriorates gradually enabling water to leave into the toilet bowl, therefore lowering the amount of water in the tank readily available for a flush.  It also has the disadvantage of increasing your water bill due to waste of water.</p>

<p>Drain pipe is not secured utilizing the required solvent cement (end of the pipe should be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds.
