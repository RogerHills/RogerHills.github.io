<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the simplest style of backflow preventer. If you have less than 6 control valves, they are the least costly, however also the least reliable option. These devices are not developed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one need to be set up at every control valve.

When one has failed, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to detect.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Short Hills NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
