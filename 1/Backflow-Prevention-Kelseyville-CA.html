<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
