When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.

Smaller sized people and families might do better with an electrical hot water heater, or an on-demand tankless" water heater as explained in the section below.</p>
