These 2 pieces have complementary grooves that when properly fitted together hold the install ring and disposal in location. Holding the mount ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, making sure that the rubber of the cushion install is fully and strongly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When set up correctly, you should not be able to get rid of the cushion install without significant stretching and pulling, and the mount ring should rotate freely around it.</p>
