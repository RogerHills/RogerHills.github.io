<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of elements that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of deterioration control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed.
