<p>This is an entirely valid concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as essential as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. However, it adds a reasonable amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively little cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Disc: Found in both bathroom and kitchens, disc faucets are recognizable by a single lever which carries on a broad, round body.
