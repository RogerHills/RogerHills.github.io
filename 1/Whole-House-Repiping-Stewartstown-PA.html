<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Stewartstown PA!</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the typical direction from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Reduced Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular instructions.</p>
<p>The system has returned to a zero demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way. This permits pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can conserve you money and time in addition to protect your health in the future. After softening a big quantity of difficult water, the exchange medium ends up being layered with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium should be charged or restored (Figure 1)when this happens.
