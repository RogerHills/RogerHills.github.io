Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
