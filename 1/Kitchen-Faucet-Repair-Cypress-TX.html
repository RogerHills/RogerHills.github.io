The pre-programmed number represents the amount of time between each regeneration. For example, a lower picked number suggests your softener will regenerate less often.

<p>Won't drain - The system might not be chopping food effectively and waste may have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are numerous leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of deterioration in a number of locations, it is probably time to repipe.
