<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>So, if you wish to stop having to wiggle your toilet manage every time you flush and are sick and tired of posting respectful signs in your bathroom everytime you have people over, get a new trip lever that actually works for your toilet. While certain specialty flush valves or flappers may require a specific trip lever to work correctly, many toilets will work simply fine with a "will fit" lever - which is great news for people who can't find their design number or who maybe have remodeled or upgraded their fixtures and want a various finish or style deal with to match the rest of their bathroom design.</p>
