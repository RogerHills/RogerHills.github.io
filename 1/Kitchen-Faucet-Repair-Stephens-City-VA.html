<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
