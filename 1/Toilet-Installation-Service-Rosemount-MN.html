<p>Plumbing is the practice, components and materials utilized in the installation, maintenance, extension, and change of all piping, fixtures, plumbing home appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with hygienic drainage or storm drainage facilities; venting systems and private or public supply of water systems, within or adjacent to any structure or structure.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
