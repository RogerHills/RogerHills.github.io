<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch moisture and sediment so that they do not enter the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that might permit tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices are subject to testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they go through regular tests later on, as well.</p>
<p>If you get your water from a neighborhood water supply, check to see if your neighborhood already softens the water. Soft water provided by an energy does not need additional softening and might trigger corrosion problems for your home.
