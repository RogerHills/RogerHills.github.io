<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
