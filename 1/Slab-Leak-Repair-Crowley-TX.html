<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
